# Cats vs Dogs Binary Image Classification

## Overview
This project focuses on building a binary image classification model to distinguish between images of cats and dogs. Such a model can be useful for automated pet identification systems or organizing image libraries.

## My Role
In this project, I contributed by:
- Finding and preparing the dataset
- Implementing the baseline model to establish initial performance metrics
- Collaborating with the team to design and implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Preparing the final presentation summarizing the project and results
